- **Engage Actively with the Text**
    
    - Don’t just pass your eyes over the words; force yourself to think about the meaning behind them. Run some thought process on the main subjects and try explain them to yourself, do an interactive procedure with the content
- **Write Margin Summaries for Each Paragraph**
    [[Marginalia#]]
    
    - **Step 1:** Read the first paragraph and write a one-sentence summary in the margin that captures its core idea.
    - **Step 2:** Do the same for the second paragraph.
- **Connect Ideas as You Progress**
    
    - **Step 3:** When you reach the third paragraph, write two summary sentences:
        - The first sentence should summarize the ideas from the first and second paragraphs (i.e., connect earlier ideas).
        - The second sentence should summarize just the third paragraph.
    - **Step 4:** For subsequent paragraphs, continue the pattern:
        - Write one sentence that summarizes everything before the current paragraph.
        - Then, write another sentence summarizing the current paragraph.
- **Review and Reinforce**
    
    - After reading, use your margin notes to review the key points quickly instead of rereading entire sections. This reinforces retention and understanding.
- **Embrace the Process Over Speed**
    
    - Accept that this method may take more time per reading, but it leads to deeper comprehension and reduces the need for last-minute cramming.
    - Recognize that active engagement (summarizing and connecting ideas) is more effective than passive reading or speed reading techniques.
- **Practice Consistently**
    
    - Use this marginalia technique regularly to build your skill and speed. Over time, you’ll get better at condensing ideas quickly and retaining the material more efficiently.

Following these steps will help ensure that you not only understand what you read but also remember it long-term, making your study sessions more effective and your review process faster.
