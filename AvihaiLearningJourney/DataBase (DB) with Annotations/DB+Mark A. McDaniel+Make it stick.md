##### **Make it stick The Science of Successful Learning Peter C. Brown Henry L. Roediger III**

*Learning is one of the key success ingredients in any area of life. Yet, most of us are learning the wrong way. Make It Stick explains why many of our existing learning strategies are ineffective, and presents a better approach that will deliver deeper, more precise and more lasting learning. These ideas and tips are useful for students, teachers, trainers, and anyone who believes in lifelong learning*

## Preface

People generally are going about learning in the wrong ways. Empirical research into how we learn  and remember shows that much of what we take for gospel  about how to learn turns out to be largely wasted effort. Even  college and medical students— whose main job is learning—  rely on study techniques that are far from optimal. At the same  time, this field of research, which goes back 125 years but has  been particularly fruitful in recent years, has yielded a body of  insights that constitute a growing science of learning: highly  effective, evidence- based strategies to replace less effective but  widely accepted practices that are rooted in theory, lore, and  intuition. But there’s a catch: the most effective learning strategies are not intuitive. 

- [n] [1][#MakeItStick] - Older study methods are widely used but obsolete in contrast to less intuitive and most effective researched techniques.

Two of us, Henry Roediger and Mark McDaniel, are cognitive scientists who have dedicated our careers to the study  of learning and memory. Peter Brown is a storyteller. We haveteamed up to explain how learning and memory work, and  we do this less by reciting the research than by telling stories  of people who have found their way to mastery of complex  knowledge and skills. Through these examples we illuminate  the principles of learning that the research shows are highly  effective. This book arose in part from a collaboration  among eleven cognitive psychologists. In 2002, the James S.  McDonnell Foundation of St. Louis, Missouri, in an effort  to better bridge the gap between basic knowledge on learning in cognitive psychology and its application in education,  awarded a research grant “Applying Cognitive Psychology  to Enhance Educational Practice” to Roediger and McDaniel  and nine others, with Roediger as the principal investigator.  The team collaborated for ten years on research to translate  cognitive science into educational science, and in many respects this book is a direct result of that work. The researchers and many of their studies are cited in the book, the notes,  and our acknowledgments. Roediger’s and McDaniel’s work  is also supported by several other funders, and McDaniel is  the co-director of :Washington University’s Center for Integrative Research in Learning and Memory. 

- [n] [2][#MakeItStick] - The creation process of this book which used many researches and translation effort of cognitive science into educational science

Most books deal with topics serially— they cover one topic,
move on to the next, and so on. We follow this strategy in the
sense that each chapter addresses new topics, but we also ap-
ply two of the primary learning principles in the book: spaced
repetition of key ideas, and the interleaving of different but
related topics. If learners spread out their study of a topic,
returning to it periodically over time, they remember it better.
Similarly, if they interleave the study of different topics, they
learn each better than if they had studied them one at a time in
sequence. Thus we unabashedly cover key ideas more than
once, repeating principles in different contexts across the book.
Preface xi
The reader will remember them better and use them more effectively as a result.

- [n] [3][#MakeItStick] - this book is written according to  latest researchers of cognitive science literature and translated into learning science
- [n] [4][#MakeItStick] - this book is using key concept which are also learned, through using spaced repetitions and interleaving of different topics for improved retention

This is a book about what people can do for themselves
right now in order to learn better and remember longer. The
responsibility for learning rests with every individual. Teachers
and coaches, too, can be more effective right now by helping
students understand these principles and by designing them
into the learning experience. This is not a book about how
education policy or the school system ought to be reformed.
Clearly, though, there are policy implications. For example,
college professors at the forefront of applying these strategies
in the classroom have experimented with their potential for
narrowing the achievement gap in the sciences, and the results
of those studies are eye opening.

- [n] [5][#MakeItStick] - this book is written in such a way which promotes memory retention and comprehension, and uses many research literature to cognitive science 
- [n] [6][#MakeItStick] - purpose of the book is to learn better and remember longer and help teachers improve their teaching methods

We write for students and teachers, of course, and for all
readers for whom effective learning is a high priority: for trainers
in business, industry, and the military; for leaders of professional
associations offering in- service training to their members;
and for coaches. We also write for lifelong learners nearing
middle age or older who want to hone their skills so as to stay
in the game.
While much remains to be known about learning and its
neural underpinnings, a large body of research has yielded
principles and practical strategies that can be put to work immediately,
at no cost, and to great effect.


- [n] [6][#MakeItStick] - this book is about developing good learning habits and for very large audience of professions.
- [n] [7][#MakeItStick] - large research body of knowledge can be already put to work for specific principals and practical learning strategies 


## Learning Is Misunderstood

Early in his career as a pilot, Matt Brown was flying a twin- engine Cessna northeast out of Harlingen, Texas, when he noticed a drop in oil pressure in his right engine. He was alone, flying through the night at eleven thousand feet, making a hotshot freight run to a plant in Kentucky that had shut down its manufacturing line awaiting product parts for assembly.
