People generally are going about learning in the wrong ways. Empirical research into how we learn  and remember shows that much of what we take for gospel  about how to learn turns out to be largely wasted effort. Even  college and medical students— whose main job is learning—  rely on study techniques that are far from optimal. At the same  time, this fi eld of research, which goes back 125 years but has  been particularly fruitful in recent years, has yielded a body of  insights that constitute a growing science of learning: highly  effective, evidence- based strategies to replace less effective but  widely accepted practices that are rooted in theory, lore, and  intuition. But there’s a catch: the most effective learning strategies are not intuitive.
