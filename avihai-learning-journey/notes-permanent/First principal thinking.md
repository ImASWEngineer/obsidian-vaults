1. Learning is not done correctly in education system
2.  Teach problem solving
	1. teach to the problems first, not the tools
		1. e.g. how engine work
			1. old approch
				1. teach screwdrivers wrenches courses etc.
			2. better approach
				2. here's an engine 
					1. now lets take it apart
					2. how we shall do this?
					3. using a screwdriver
					4. that's what the screwdriver is for
					5. we need a wrench
					6. that's what a wrench is for
			3. the relevance of tools becomes apparent
			4. anything can be taught for free - no college
			5. we can see if someone is a hard worker which finishes assignments - college value
			6. society
			7. we need to make learning as much as video game as possible
				1. learning interactive and engaging
				2. remove grading which stopes progress
				3. give people to progress in their own pace in each subject according to interest
			8. lectures are not engaging enough for education
			9. learning should not be a chore
			10. what you should not use in the future you should not learn
			11. explain the why we should teach the stuff we teach for the future. the why of things - motivation for learning
			12. make this enteratining
			13. critical thinking - assuming anything is true
				1. need to analyze closely what is supposedly true
				2. analyze things by first principles
				3. not by analogy or not by convention
					1. difficult to gain insight how to fix the stuff
					2. need to make sure that the underlying premises  or the foundation of the knowledge is valid and applicable  
					3. reaching a conclusion which is driven by the underlying premises and the connection between those premises
					4.
