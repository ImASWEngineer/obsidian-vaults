### **_Ideas (Core Concepts and Takeaways)_**

1. ***Atomic Notes**: Each note should contain just one idea to maintain clarity and usability.*
2. ***Connectivity**: Notes should be linked based on relationships, forming an interconnected network.*
3. ***No Categories, Just Tags**: Categories can be rigid and limiting, whereas tags allow flexibility.*
4. ***Trust the Process**: Instead of hoarding information, actively engage with it by summarizing, rewriting, and linking notes.*
5. ***Layers of Knowledge**: Notes evolve from basic data to interpretations and synthesized insights.*
6. ***Writing Improves Learning**: The Zettelkasten is not just about storing knowledge but about using it to improve thinking and writing.*
7. ***Outlining with Notes**: Notes can be arranged into outlines for writing projects, making writing easier and more structured.*
